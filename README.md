#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
In the technology industry, software engineering plays a critical role by providing tools, frameworks, and methodologies to develop complex systems that meet user needs while ensuring quality, maintainability, and sustainability.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. The Birth of Structured Programming (1960s): This introduced structured programming techniques that reduced errors and improved code readability.
2. The Introduction of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP, 1980s): OOP revolutionized how software was developed by promoting code reuse and modularity.
3. Agile Methodology (2001): Agile introduced a flexible approach to software development that prioritizes collaboration, iterative progress, and customer feedback.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Planning: Define project goals, requirements, and feasibility.
2. Analysis: Gather and document business requirements and system specifications.
3. Design: Create system architecture, design software modules, and select technologies.
4. Implementation: Write the actual code based on the design documents.
5. Testing: Validate the software by detecting bugs and ensuring functionality.
6. Deployment: Release the software to users.
7. Maintenance: Provide ongoing support, updates, and fixes.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
- Waterfall: A linear and sequential approach where each phase must be completed before the next begins. Example: Building a safety-critical system (e.g., aerospace software) where requirements are clear and unchanging.
- Agile: An iterative, flexible approach where development occurs in cycles (sprints) and changes can be made as needed. Example: Developing a mobile application where features and design evolve based on user feedback.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer: Responsible for writing code, implementing features, fixing bugs, and collaborating with other team members to build software systems.
Quality Assurance Engineer: Focuses on testing the software to identify defects and ensure it meets quality standards. They run manual and automated tests and document the results.
Project Manager: Oversees the projectâ€™s progress, manages timelines, and coordinates communication among team members to ensure the project is completed on time and within scope.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs: Tools that provide features like code completion, debugging, and syntax highlighting. Examples: Visual Studio, IntelliJ IDEA.
VCS: Systems that track changes in code, allowing teams to collaborate and maintain version history. Examples: Git, SVN.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Time Management: Breaking tasks into smaller, manageable parts and prioritizing them using techniques like time-blocking.
Dealing with Bugs: Writing clean, modular code and using debugging tools to identify and resolve issues efficiently.
Keeping Up with Technology: Engaging in continuous learning through online courses, conferences, and reading documentation.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing: Tests individual components or functions. Ensures that each piece of the code works correctly.
Integration Testing: Tests the interaction between components. Ensures that different modules or services work well together.
System Testing: Tests the complete system to ensure it meets the requirements.
Acceptance Testing: Performed by the end-user to verify if the system meets the intended use and business needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of designing inputs (prompts) to effectively communicate with AI models like GPT or DALL-E to achieve desired outputs.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt: "Write about technology."
Improved Prompt: "Write a 300-word article explaining the impact of artificial intelligence on healthcare, including examples of AI applications in diagnostics and treatment."
